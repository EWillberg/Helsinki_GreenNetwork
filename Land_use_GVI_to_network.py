Usage:
    This script is an extension for the script Street_view_GVI_to_network.
    It is intended for complementing the Google Street View (GSV) based green view index (GVI) with land use
    based green view index. The script identifies all the segments without GVI index and calculates the land use
    based GVI for these segments
